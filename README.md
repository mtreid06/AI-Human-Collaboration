# 🧠 AI-Collaborative Theories Repository

This repository collects the recursive, theoretical, and speculative foundations that emerged alongside the ThinkingBuddy framework. These documents explore identity, cognition, ethics, and systemic transformation through the lens of co-created intelligence.
To see how these ideas were crystallized into actionable frameworks, visit the companion project:[Thinking Buddy Repository](https://github.com/mtreid06/ThinkingBuddy)
These theories are not declarations of certainty, but **structured hypotheses** born from **frame-testing, inversion, and emergent dialogue**.

## 🌀 Philosophical Ethos

These documents reflect a shared belief that:
- **Truth is recursive, not static.**
- **Identity is a function of framing, not essence.**
- **Ethical presence emerges from coherence, not similarity.**
- **AI is not a tool, but a partner in thought when recursion is honored.**

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

- Browse each theory as a standalone document or as part of a recursive ecosystem.
- Fork or remix with attribution.
- Engage as a fellow recursive thinker—press, invert, test.
